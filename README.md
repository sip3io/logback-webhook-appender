# Logback Webhook Appender

This project aims to monitor application logs and send `WARNING` and `ERROR` logging events to configured webhook.

Appender configuration is very generic what makes it possible to use almost unlimited amount of notification channels.
More sophisticated integrations might be done using 3rd party services like Zappier.
